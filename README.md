# Useful Snippets Extension

A Chrome Extension with Useful JavaScript snippets for testing

Feel free to contribute to this set of snippets.

What we are looking for are short JavaScript snippets that can run from a popup menu and provide small useful aids to support testing.

And are also small enough that the provide useful examples of using JavaScript from the console or as Bookmarklets and help people learn to use JavaScript in their testing.
